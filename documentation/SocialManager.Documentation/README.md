# Social Manager

## Intent
The Social Manager application shows as a blog, but is so much more. It is a full social media management platform that allows users to manage multiple social media accounts, schedule posts, analyze performance metrics, and engage with their audience all from a single interface.

## Blog
The blog component of Social Manager allows users to create and publish blog posts directly to their social media accounts. Users can write articles, add images and videos, and format their content using a rich text editor. The blog also supports scheduling posts for future publication, allowing users to plan their content in advance.
More detailed information about the blog features can be found in the [Blog Documentation](documentation/SocialManager.Documentation/Intent/Blog.md).

## Live video restreaming
